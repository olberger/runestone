"Ok, this is a question that has the potential to start nasty religious wars."
"  The technical answer is that this book uses a version of Python called "
"`Skulpt <http://skulpt.org>`_.  It is entirely written in Javascript so that"
" it runs right in the browser.  We think this is very cool.  Now some poeple"
" get all crazy about whether they should teach Python 3 or Python 2.  The "
"truth is that for CS1 and CS2 it really doesn't matter.  Skulpt can do print"
" with or without parenthesis, and lets face it for CS1 thats really all that"
" matters.   Sure, there are differences, but are you really going to start "
"out by teaching your students about `dict_keys` and how they are different "
"from a `list`.  If so, I think you are cruel and you should teach your "
"students APL.  If you want to slant your teaching toward Python 3, you can "
"do that with this book.  If you want to lean towards 2, you can do that too."

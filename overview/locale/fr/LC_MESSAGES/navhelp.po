"One of the most important things that you can do when you are learning a "
"programming language is to write programs.  Unfortunately, typical textbooks"
" allow you to read about programming but don't allow you to practice.  We "
"have created a unique tool called **ActiveCode** that allows you to write, "
"modify, and execute programs right in the text itself (right from the web "
"browser).  Although this is certainly not the way real programs are written,"
" it provides an excellent environment for learning a programming language "
"like Python since you can experiment with the language as you are reading."

"Take a look at the ActiveCode interpreter in action.  If we take a simple "
"Python program and make it active, you will see that it can be executed "

"In addition to ActiveCode, you can also execute Python code with the "
"assistance of a unique visualization tool.  This tool, known as "
"**CodeLens**, allows you to control the step by step execution of a program."
"  It also lets you see the values of all variables as they are created and "
"modified.  The following example shows CodeLens in action on the same simple"
" program as we saw above.  Remember that in ActiveCode, the source code "
"executes from beginning to end and you can see the final result.  In "
"Codelens you can see and control the step by step progress.  Try clicking on"
" the *Forward* button below."

"Our toolset provides a number of different things that will help you to "
"learn to program in the Python programming language. Aside from reading the "
"text, it is sometimes useful to hear someone tell you about different "

" if you click on the video shown below, you will hear us talk about the "

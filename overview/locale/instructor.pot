msgid "Ok, this is a question that has the potential to start nasty religious wars.  The technical answer is that this book uses a version of Python called `Skulpt <http://skulpt.org>`_.  It is entirely written in Javascript so that it runs right in the browser.  We think this is very cool.  Now some poeple get all crazy about whether they should teach Python 3 or Python 2.  The truth is that for CS1 and CS2 it really doesn't matter.  Skulpt can do print with or without parenthesis, and lets face it for CS1 thats really all that matters.   Sure, there are differences, but are you really going to start out by teaching your students about `dict_keys` and how they are different from a `list`.  If so, I think you are cruel and you should teach your students APL.  If you want to slant your teaching toward Python 3, you can do that with this book.  If you want to lean towards 2, you can do that too."
